    },
    {
      "question": "What testing strategies are covered?",
      "answer": "The skill covers unit tests with pytest, integration tests with TestClient, mock servers for parallel development, contract testing against OpenAPI specs, and performance testing with Locust."

    {
      "question": "How do I deploy a Python API to production?",
      "answer": "The skill provides Docker multi-stage builds, Kubernetes manifests with HPA, Gunicorn/Uvicorn production configs, and GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines for both FastAPI and Django."
    },
    {
      "question": "What observability tools are recommended?",
      "answer": "The skill recommends structlog or loguru for structured logging, OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing, Prometheus for metrics, and Sentry for error tracking. Health check endpoints are also covered."
