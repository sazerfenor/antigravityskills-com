      "question": "What's the difference between correlation and causation?",
      "answer": "Correlation shows variables move together; causation means one actually causes changes in another. Use regression with controls, A/B tests, or causal inference methods to establish causation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I choose between ML and statistical methods?",
      "answer": "Use statistics when testing hypotheses, understanding 'why', or with small samples. Use ML when discovering patterns, predicting 'what', with large datasets, or when accuracy matters more than interpretability."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I report beyond p-values?",
      "answer": "Always report effect sizes (Cohen's d, odds ratios), confidence intervals, and sample sizes. Statistical significance doesn't mean practical significance—a tiny effect can be 'significant' with enough data."
