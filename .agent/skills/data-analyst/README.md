# Data Analyst

Transform data into actionable insights and compelling narratives that drive business decisions.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Simply describe your data analysis challenge, and this skill will:
1. Recommend the right statistical or ML method
2. Help design metrics and thresholds
3. Structure your findings as a compelling story

## ✨ What It Does

**Analysis**:
- Trend detection and time series analysis
- A/B testing and statistical comparisons
- Attribution modeling and conversion analysis
- User segmentation and clustering
- Threshold design for decision logic

**Storytelling**:
- Transform findings into executive narratives
- Create compelling data visualizations
- Build persuasive presentations

## 🔧 How It Works

```
Problem → Classify → Select Method → Design Metrics → Set Thresholds → Tell Story
```

1. **Classify** your problem (trend, comparison, attribution, segmentation)
2. **Select** appropriate statistical/ML methods from reference guides
3. **Design** metrics with clear calculations and edge case handling
4. **Set** thresholds using statistical, business, or data-driven approaches
5. **Tell** the story with narrative arc and visualization

## 🔔 When to Use

- Designing data analysis algorithms
- Choosing between statistical tests or ML methods
- Setting decision boundaries or classification criteria
- Detecting trends, growth patterns, or anomalies
- Presenting analytics to executives
- Designing and interpreting A/B tests

## 📝 Examples

**Trend Detection**:
> "How do I detect if this keyword is trending up?"
→ Uses time series analysis with change point detection

**A/B Testing**:
> "Are these two groups statistically different?"
→ Recommends t-test or Mann-Whitney with effect sizes

**Executive Reporting**:
> "How do I present these churn findings to leadership?"
→ Structures as Problem-Solution story with ROI

**Segmentation**:
> "How do I group users by behavior?"
→ Guides K-means clustering with profile interpretation
