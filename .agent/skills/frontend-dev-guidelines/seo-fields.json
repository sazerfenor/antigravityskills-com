  "faqItems": [
    {
      "question": "What is useSuspenseQuery and why should I use it?",
      "answer": "useSuspenseQuery from TanStack Query integrates with React Suspense to handle loading states declaratively. Instead of checking isLoading in every component, Suspense boundaries catch the loading state and show a fallback. This eliminates boilerplate and prevents layout shift."
    },
    {
      "question": "When should I use lazy loading?",
      "answer": "Use React.lazy() for heavy components like DataGrid, charts, rich text editors, and route pages. This splits your bundle so users only download code they need, improving initial load time."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the recommended file structure for features?",
      "answer": "Create features/{feature-name}/ with subdirectories: api/ for data services, components/ for UI, hooks/ for custom hooks, helpers/ for utilities, and types/ for TypeScript interfaces. Export the public API from index.ts."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why no early returns for loading states?",
      "answer": "Early returns like 'if (isLoading) return <Spinner />' cause Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) because the component unmounts and remounts. SuspenseLoader maintains consistent layout during loading, improving Core Web Vitals."

  "skillContent": "---\nname: frontend-dev-guidelines\ndescription: Use when creating React/TypeScript components, pages, or features. For modern patterns including Suspense, useSuspenseQuery, lazy loading, MUI v7 styling, TanStack Router, and performance optimization.\n---\n\n# Frontend Development Guidelines\n\n> **Purpose**: Comprehensive guide for modern React development with Suspense-based data fetching, lazy loading, and performance optimization.\n\n## When to Use\n\n- Creating new components or pages\n- Building features with TanStack Query\n- Setting up TanStack Router routes\n- Styling with MUI v7\n- Performance optimization\n- Organizing frontend code\n\n---\n\n## Quick Start Checklists\n\n### New Component Checklist\n\n- [ ] Use `React.FC<Props>` pattern with TypeScript\n- [ ] Lazy load if heavy: `React.lazy(() => import())`\n- [ ] Wrap in `<SuspenseLoader>` for loading states\n- [ ] Use `useSuspenseQuery` for data fetching\n- [ ] Import aliases: `@/`, `~types`, `~components`, `~features`\n- [ ] Styles: Inline if <100 lines, separate if >100 lines\n- [ ] Use `useCallback` for handlers passed to children\n- [ ] Default export at bottom\n- [ ] No early returns with loading spinners\n- [ ] Use `useMuiSnackbar` for notifications\n\n### New Feature Checklist\n\n- [ ] Create `features/{feature-name}/` directory\n- [ ] Subdirectories: `api/`, `components/`, `hooks/`, `helpers/`, `types/`\n- [ ] API service: `api/{feature}Api.ts`\n- [ ] Route: `routes/{feature-name}/index.tsx`\n- [ ] Lazy load feature components\n- [ ] Export public API from `index.ts`\n\n---\n\n## Import Aliases\n\n| Alias | Resolves To | Example |\n|-------|-------------|--------- |\n| `@/` | `src/` | `import { apiClient } from '@/lib/apiClient'` |\n| `~types` | `src/types` | `import type { User } from '~types/user'` |\n| `~components` | `src/components` | `import { SuspenseLoader } from '~components/SuspenseLoader'` |\n| `~features` | `src/features` | `import { authApi } from '~features/auth'` |\n\n---\n\n## Core Principles\n\n1. **Lazy Load Heavy Components**: Routes, DataGrid, charts, editors\n2. **Suspense for Loading**: Use SuspenseLoader, not early returns\n3. **useSuspenseQuery**: Primary data fetching for new code\n4. **Organized Features**: `api/`, `components/`, `hooks/`, `helpers/`\n5. **Styles by Size**: <100 inline, >100 separate file\n6. **Import Aliases**: `@/`, `~types`, `~components`, `~features`\n7. **No Early Returns**: Prevents Cumulative Layout Shift\n8. **useMuiSnackbar**: For all user notifications\n",
