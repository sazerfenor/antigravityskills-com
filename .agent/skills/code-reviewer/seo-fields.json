  "skillContent": "---\nname: code-reviewer\ndescription: Automated code review assistant for analyzing Pull Requests and enforcing coding standards. Use when you need to review complex PRs, check for anti-patterns, or generate quality reports.\n---\n\n# Code Reviewer\n\nAutomated code review assistant that integrates static analysis, best practice auditing, and report generation.\n\n## Agent Protocols\n\n1.  **Context Analysis**: Always start by analyzing the project context and `references/coding_standards.md` to understand the rules.\n2.  **Progressive Review**:\n    - Step 1: Run `pr_analyzer.py` for structural and high-level checks.\n    - Step 2: Run `code_quality_checker.py` for deep static analysis.\n    - Step 3: Use `review_report_generator.py` to compile findings.\n3.  **Constructive Feedback**: When providing feedback, reference specific items from `references/code_review_checklist.md`.\n\n## Tool Definitions\n\n### 1. PR Analyzer (Script)\n\nAnalyzes a Pull Request or a local branch for common issues and structural constraints.\n\n-   **Execution**: `python .agent/skills/code-reviewer/scripts/pr_analyzer.py [options] <path>`\n-   **When to use**: At the beginning of a review to catch obvious errors.\n\n### 2. Code Quality Checker (Script)\n\nPerforms deep static analysis to identify performance bottlenecks and anti-patterns.\n\n-   **Execution**: `python .agent/skills/code-reviewer/scripts/code_quality_checker.py [options] <path>`\n-   **When to use**: Before merging, to ensure codebase health.\n\n### 3. Review Report Generator (Script)\n\nGenerates a formatted report for stakeholders.\n\n-   **Execution**: `python .agent/skills/code-reviewer/scripts/review_report_generator.py [options]`\n-   **When to use**: To summarize findings for non-technical stakeholders or final approval.\n",
  "readmeContent": "# Code Reviewer\n\nComprehensive automated code review toolkit for analyzing Pull Requests and enforcing coding standards.\n\n## 🚀 Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# Analyze a PR\npython .agent/skills/code-reviewer/scripts/pr_analyzer.py <project-path>\n\n# Check Code Quality\npython .agent/skills/code-reviewer/scripts/code_quality_checker.py <target-path>\n```\n\n## ✨ What It Does\n\nThis skill provides a suite of tools to automate the code review process:\n\n1.  **PR Analysis**: Scaffolding checks, structural validation, and best practice enforcement.\n2.  **Quality Checking**: Deep static analysis to find performance issues and complex anti-patterns.\n3.  **Report Generation**: Creates professional review reports suitable for team consumption.\n\n## 🔧 How It Works\n\nThe skill operates through three main scripts located in the `scripts/` directory:\n\n-   `pr_analyzer.py`: Validates PR structure and basic sanity checks.\n-   `code_quality_checker.py`: Runs deeper analysis rules.\n-   `review_report_generator.py`: Aggregates data into a readable format.\n\nIt references rules and standards defined in the `references/` directory:\n-   `code_review_checklist.md`: The rulebook for reviews.\n-   `coding_standards.md`: The definitive guide for coding style.\n-   `common_antipatterns.md`: Examples of what to avoid.\n\n## 🔔 When to Use\n\n-   **Pre-Merge**: Run the `pr_analyzer` on every Pull Request.\n-   **Periodic Audit**: Run the `code_quality_checker` on the main branch weekly.\n-   **Review Session**: Consult the checklists when performing manual reviews.\n\n## 📝 Examples\n\n### Running a full quality check\n\n```bash\npython .agent/skills/code-reviewer/scripts/code_quality_checker.py ./src --verbose\n```\n\n### Generating a weekly report\n\n```bash\npython .agent/skills/code-reviewer/scripts/review_report_generator.py --format markdown --output weekly-report.md\n```\n\n## Tech Stack Support\n\n-   **Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, Swift, Kotlin\n-   **Frontend**: React, Next.js, React Native, Flutter\n-   **Backend**: Node.js, Express, GraphQL, REST APIs\n"
