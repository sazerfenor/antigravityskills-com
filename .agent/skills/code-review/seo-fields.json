  "skillContent": "---\nname: code-review\ndescription: Use this skill when reviewing code for bugs, security issues, performance problems, or best practices. For PR reviews, code audits, refactoring assessments, and identifying potential issues before production.\nmetadata:\n  version: \"1.0.0\"\n  author: \"antigravity-skill-creator\"\n---\n\n# Code Review\n\n## Overview\n\nA comprehensive code review skill that analyzes code for correctness, maintainability, performance, and security. Helps identify potential issues before they reach production by providing structured, actionable feedback.\n\n## Protocols\n\n### 1. Gather Context\n\n- Identify the files to review using Glob patterns\n- Understand the project structure and conventions\n- Check for existing linting/formatting rules\n\n### 2. Analyze Code Structure\n\n- Review file organization and module structure\n- Check for proper separation of concerns\n- Verify naming conventions are consistent\n\n### 3. Check for Common Issues\n\n- Logic errors and edge cases\n- Error handling completeness\n- Resource management (memory leaks, unclosed handles)\n- Thread safety issues in concurrent code\n- Input validation gaps\n\n### 4. Evaluate Code Quality\n\n- Readability and clarity\n- DRY principle adherence\n- SOLID principles compliance\n- Appropriate abstraction levels\n- Test coverage adequacy\n\n### 5. Performance Review\n\n- Algorithm complexity analysis\n- Database query efficiency\n- Memory usage patterns\n- Caching opportunities\n\n### 6. Security Review\n\n- SQL injection vulnerabilities\n- XSS attack vectors\n- Authentication/authorization gaps\n- Sensitive data exposure\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Be Specific**: Point to exact lines and provide concrete suggestions\n2. **Prioritize Issues**: Distinguish between critical bugs and style preferences\n3. **Explain Why**: Don't just say what's wrong, explain the reasoning\n4. **Suggest Solutions**: Provide alternative implementations when possible\n5. **Acknowledge Good Code**: Recognize well-written sections\n6. **Consider Context**: Understand the constraints and trade-offs\n7. **Be Constructive**: Frame feedback positively and professionally\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n**User**: \"Review this Python function for issues\"\n**Action**: Analyze the function for logic errors, type safety, naming conventions, and provide improvement suggestions with code examples.\n\n**User**: \"Check this PR for security vulnerabilities\"\n**Action**: Focus on security-critical patterns like SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass, and sensitive data handling.\n\n**User**: \"Audit this module's performance\"\n**Action**: Analyze algorithm complexity, identify O(n²) patterns, suggest optimizations like caching or data structure changes.\n\n## Review Output Format\n\nStructure your review as follows:\n\n```markdown\n## Summary\n{Overall assessment in 1-2 sentences}\n\n## Critical Issues 🔴\n{Must fix before merge}\n\n## Improvements 🟡\n{Should consider}\n\n## Suggestions 🟢\n{Nice to have}\n\n## Positive Notes ✨\n{What's done well}\n```\n",
  
  "readmeContent": "# Code Review\n\n> Expert code reviewer for bugs, security, performance, and best practices\n\n## 🚀 Quick Start\n\nSimply ask for a code review:\n\n```\nReview this function for potential issues\nCheck this PR for security vulnerabilities  \nAudit this module's performance\n```\n\n## ✨ What It Does\n\nThis skill performs comprehensive code reviews covering:\n\n- **Correctness**: Logic errors, edge cases, error handling\n- **Security**: SQL injection, XSS, authentication gaps\n- **Performance**: Algorithm complexity, query efficiency, caching opportunities\n- **Quality**: DRY/SOLID principles, readability, test coverage\n\n## 🔧 How It Works\n\n1. **Gathers Context** - Understands project structure and conventions\n2. **Analyzes Structure** - Reviews file organization and separation of concerns\n3. **Checks Issues** - Identifies bugs, vulnerabilities, and performance problems\n4. **Evaluates Quality** - Assesses readability, principles adherence, test coverage\n5. **Provides Feedback** - Delivers prioritized, actionable suggestions\n\n## 🔔 When to Use\n\n- Before merging a Pull Request\n- When auditing existing code for issues\n- During refactoring to ensure quality\n- For security-focused code audits\n- When optimizing performance-critical code\n\n## 📝 Examples\n\n### Example 1: General Code Review\n\n**User**: \"Review this authentication function\"\n\n**Output**:\n```markdown\n## Summary\nThe function has a critical security issue and several code quality improvements.\n\n## Critical Issues 🔴\n- Line 15: Password comparison vulnerable to timing attacks\n\n## Improvements 🟡\n- Add rate limiting for failed attempts\n- Use parameterized queries\n\n## Positive Notes ✨\n- Good separation of concerns\n- Clear error messages\n```\n\n### Example 2: Performance Audit\n\n**User**: \"Audit this data processing module for performance\"\n\n**Output**:\n```markdown\n## Summary\nO(n²) complexity in the main loop causing slowdowns with large datasets.\n\n## Critical Issues 🔴\n- Line 42: Nested loop with list membership check - convert to set\n\n## Improvements 🟡\n- Add caching for repeated calculations\n- Use generator expressions for memory efficiency\n```\n\n## 📊 Review Output Structure\n\nAll reviews follow a consistent format:\n\n| Section | Purpose |\n|:--------|:--------|\n| **Summary** | 1-2 sentence overall assessment |\n| **Critical Issues 🔴** | Must fix before merge |\n| **Improvements 🟡** | Should consider |\n| **Suggestions 🟢** | Nice to have |\n| **Positive Notes ✨** | What's done well |\n"
