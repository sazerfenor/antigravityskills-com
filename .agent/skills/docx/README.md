# Docx Skill

> Use this skill when you need to create, edit, or analyze Microsoft Word (.docx) documents, especially for tasks involving tracked changes (redlining), comments, authentic formatting, or deep XML inspection.

## 🚀 Quick Start

To read a Word document and see tracked changes:

```
Read "contract-v1.docx" and show me what changed.
```

To create a new Word document:

```
Create a new legal memo template in Word format.
```

## ✨ What It Does

- **Deep Analysis**: Extracts text while preserving tracked changes, comments, and structure.
- **Redlining**: Edits documents with precise "Tracked Changes" (insertions/deletions), essential for legal and business review.
- **Creation**: Generates professional .docx files from scratch using JavaScript templates.
- **XML Manipulation**: Provides low-level access to Open Office XML for complex tasks.

## 🔧 How It Works

This skill combines multiple tools to handle different document tasks:

- **Analysis**: Uses `pandoc` to convert .docx to markdown for reading.
- **Creation**: Uses `docx-js` (Node.js) to build new documents.
- **Editing**: Uses Python (ooxml library) to unpack, modify, and repack XML.

```

## 🔔 When to Use

**Trigger Keywords**: `word`, `docx`, `document`, `redline`, `track changes`, `comment`

**Typical Scenarios**:
- "Summarize this contract and list all redlined changes."
- "Update the date in this agreement but keep the change tracking on."
- "Extract all comments from this student essay."
- "Create a report with specific formatting."

## 📝 Examples

### Example 1: Redlining (Tracked Changes)

**User**: "Change the deadline from 'May 1st' to 'June 1st' in `agreement.docx` and show track changes."

**Result**: The skill unpacks the document, modifies the XML to wrap the change in `<w:del>` (May 1st) and `<w:ins>` (June 1st) tags, and saves it as a new version.

### Example 2: Reading with Context

**User**: "Read `proposal.docx`."

**Result**: Converts the document to Markdown. If there are existing tracked changes, they appear as `[deleted text]{.delete}` and `[inserted text]{.insert}` so you don't miss context.
