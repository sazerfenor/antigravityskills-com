# AI/ML Developer

> Build production-grade LLM applications, RAG systems, and intelligent agents with comprehensive ML capabilities.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Simply reference this skill in your AI coding assistant, and it will be activated when you work on:
- LLM application development (GPT-4o, Claude, Llama)
- RAG system implementation
- AI agent design
- Prompt engineering
- Model evaluation
- ML/Statistics for business intelligence

**Example prompts:**
```
"Build a RAG system for our documentation with hybrid search"
"Design a multi-agent workflow for customer support"
"Optimize this prompt for better accuracy and lower cost"
```

## ✨ What It Does

This skill transforms your AI assistant into an expert AI/ML developer with deep knowledge of:

### LLM Integration
- Model selection and integration (OpenAI, Anthropic, open-source)
- Function calling and structured outputs
- Cost optimization and caching strategies
- Multi-model orchestration

### RAG Systems
- Vector database selection (Pinecone, Qdrant, Weaviate, Chroma)
- Embedding strategies and chunking patterns
- Hybrid search (dense + sparse)
- Reranking with cross-encoders

### Agent Frameworks
- LangChain/LangGraph for complex workflows
- LlamaIndex for data-centric applications
- Multi-agent collaboration patterns
- Tool integration and memory systems

### Prompt Engineering
- Chain-of-thought and few-shot learning
- Constitutional AI for self-correction
- Template systems and versioning
- A/B testing and optimization

### Evaluation & Monitoring
- Automated metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore)
- LLM-as-Judge patterns
- A/B testing frameworks
- Regression detection

### ML Methods
- Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical)
- Classification (Logistic, Decision Trees, Random Forest)
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA)
- Feature engineering best practices

## 🔧 How It Works

The skill provides structured knowledge across four reference documents:

| Reference | Focus Area |
|:----------|:-----------|
| [rag-patterns.md](references/rag-patterns.md) | RAG architecture, retrieval strategies |
| [prompt-techniques.md](references/prompt-techniques.md) | Prompt engineering patterns |
| [ml-methods.md](references/ml-methods.md) | ML vs Statistics decision guide |
| [evaluation-metrics.md](references/evaluation-metrics.md) | LLM evaluation frameworks |

When triggered, the assistant:
1. Identifies the specific AI/ML task
2. Loads relevant reference materials
3. Applies production best practices
4. Provides implementation guidance with code examples

## 🔔 When to Use

**Trigger this skill when you need to:**

- 🏗️ Build LLM-powered applications from scratch
- 🔍 Implement semantic search or document Q&A
- 🤖 Design AI agents with tool use and memory
- ✍️ Optimize prompts for reliability and cost
- 📊 Evaluate LLM performance systematically
- 📈 Apply ML for customer segmentation or prediction
- 🔧 Debug RAG systems with poor retrieval quality
- 💰 Reduce LLM costs while maintaining quality

## 📝 Examples

### RAG System Implementation
```
User: "Build a RAG system for our internal wiki with 50K documents"

Assistant response includes:
- Vector database recommendation (e.g., Qdrant for filtering)
- Chunking strategy (semantic, 512 tokens)
- Hybrid search implementation
- Reranking with cross-encoders
- Evaluation metrics setup
```

### Prompt Optimization
```
User: "This prompt is unreliable, sometimes returns wrong format"

Assistant response includes:
- Root cause analysis
- Structured output with JSON mode
- Few-shot examples for consistency
- Self-verification pattern

```

### Customer Segmentation
```
User: "Segment our customers based on purchase behavior"

Assistant response includes:
- ML vs Statistics decision
- K-Means or DBSCAN recommendation
- Feature engineering approach
- Cluster interpretation guide
- Validation metrics
```
