In the center of this wall, the theme from the reference image is presented in a monumental artistic form. The image is vivid and three-dimensional, rising toward the viewer, becoming the focal point of the entire space.\n\nA system-generated exhibition title plaque is installed below the central wall. The title must be abstract, symbolic, and poetic, and must reflect a contemporary artwork. No price display is provided.\n\nThe floor is polished granite with a reflectance of 0.35–0.40. Patterns and light derived from the reference image cascade across the surface of the work, resonating with the entire space as if responding to the footsteps of visitors. Tactile paving bricks are in a similar color, seamlessly integrated, but only 5 mm high, providing a clear texture. The work extends in a straight line from the entrance to the wall, creating a pause point before the artwork. After viewing, visitors are naturally guided to an opening on the right side (3 m wide x 3 m high). In emergencies, floor-level emergency lighting ensures illumination of 1 lux.\n\nThe left and right walls and the ceiling each reinterpret an abstract element from the reference image, transforming the entire space into a single artwork. The flow of color, form, and light unifies the experience into an artistic whole.\n\nVisitor capacity is limited to 8–25 people. All visitors face the large wall, moving in a straight line and pausing at the designated point. No one looks back toward the entrance. Only one staff member is stationed near the right-side entrance beside the wall. All faces are blurred to ensure anonymity.\n\nThe composition is stable, with the central vanishing point always aligned with the center of the wall. Verticality is within ±0.5°. Floor reflections are precise, human figures appear natural. Hands always show five fingers, eyes are symmetrical within a 3% margin. Fabrics remain flat with no deformation.\n\nForbidden content: Elements unrelated to the reference image, missing or broken tactile paving, visitors facing the entrance, logos or watermarks, overcrowding, toy-like gloss, 2D flat projections, neon glow, teal-orange tones, oversaturation, perspective collapse, mismatched reflections, anatomical anomalies, extra limbs, distorted faces, excessive outlines, banding, or vignetting.\n\nDoD: The entire venue will be a contemporary artwork centered on the theme of the reference image, with the innermost structure forming a unified experience. The tactile paving synchronizes perfectly with the flow of light, creating a clear pause point. Visitors are immersed in the space itself, and even in reproduction, SSIM will remain stable at 0.95 or above.",
