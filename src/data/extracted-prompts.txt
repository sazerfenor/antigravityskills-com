## [example_3] Character Cloning

Based on the uploaded reference character, shoot a real-life scene in a spacious Tokyo girl's apartment—a bright, lived-in studio, spatial proportions close to 1LDK. The room should contain white walls, warm wooden floors, beige curtains, a low bed with soft bedding, a desk with cosmetics, bookshelves, plants, a standing mirror, a rug, scattered personal items, and a compact kitchen area at the back of the room. The room must have strong depth of field, with distinct foreground, middle ground, and deep background layers.

Place about thirty characters identical to the reference character (face, hairstyle, clothing all identical to the reference character) in the room, each in a different action or interaction state. Adjust the distance, scale, height, and visibility between characters to make the room density look natural.

Foreground (very close to the lens/partially occluded):

- A person walking past the lens, slightly out of focus

- A hand or shoulder entering the frame

- One person approaching the lens

- One person half-hidden behind a large plant

- One person sitting directly in front, tying hair

- One person kneeling by the table organizing items

Middle ground (main room area):

- One person stretching by the bed

- One person sitting on the bed checking phone

- One person lying on the bed

- One person reaching under the bed

- One person organizing cosmetics on the table

- One person flipping through books on the bookshelf

- One person standing in front of the mirror

- One person squatting on the rug

- One person leaning against the wall

- One person looking out the window

- One person adjusting curtains

- One person carrying clothes

- One person drinking water from a cup

- One person arranging pillows

- One person sitting on the floor eating snacks

- One person doing a small jump or motion blur action

- One person moving a small chair

Background (deep depth/near kitchen and... corridor):

- One person standing by the stove drinking water

- One person opening the cupboard

- One person sitting on a stool

- One person leaning against the doorway

- One person walking towards the corridor

- One person's silhouette partially blocked by the refrigerator

- One person reaching for a high shelf

- One person standing far in the entrance area

- One person faintly visible through the corridor frame

- One person sitting on the floor near the kitchen rug

Ensure strong layering occlusion: foreground figures partially obscure middle ground figures, background figures appear smaller and present natural perspective falloff. Naturally scatter the thirty figures, avoiding symmetry or grid alignment. All figures use soft natural daylight lighting to ensure perfect blending with the environment.

Place the figures in a real-life background matching the illustration pose and composition, while faithfully retaining the illustration's texture and style. Use realistic lighting, depth of field, and subtle camera effects to make the illustration seamlessly connect with the real environment.

## [example_10] Add Giant Creature to City Image

Use the uploaded city photo as the base map. Do not change the real buildings, streets, vehicles or people in the photo. Maintain the authenticity of the photo. Add a very huge, stylized illustration creature in the sky above and behind the buildings, as if it is overlooking the entire city. The creature should be drawn in a flat graphic style, with clear outlines, and use limited neon colors (such as soft neon green, neon yellow and lime green), similar to murals or poster illustrations.
Creature Design:
- Fantasy whimsical world, not horror or violent
- Composed of layered shapes, scales, hair or floral patterns

- Use correct overlapping methods: building edge in front, creature behind, making it blend into the scene
- If necessary, add very soft shadows or color reflections on the surface of nearby buildings, but keep it subtle
- Maintain the original brightness of the sky, making the illustration clearly stand out
Optional:
- Add some small, simple illustration figures (flat, minimalist style) on the street, such as walking a dog or crossing the road, but do not block real people.
Overall atmosphere: Dreamy surreal city scene, a huge, friendly illustration creature appears above realistic buildings, combining real photos with simple modern illustrations.

It is located in the center of a clean light gray background, floating gently in the air. The style is surreal, tactile and modern, creating a comfortable and playful feeling. Use studio lighting and high-resolution rendering.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [example_13] Crystal Texture Emoji

A photorealistic, highly detailed image featuring [a 3D Polaroid camera] rendered in clear, highly polished transparent glass or crystal material. [The body has distinct thickness and dimensional depth, the iconic shape of a classic Polaroid camera—boxy body, front lens, top viewfinder, front shutter button, and bottom film slot—all presented in simplified yet extremely precise geometric structures, making it instantly recognizable without any patterns]. All edges are treated with rounded chamfers and smooth curved surfaces, creating elegant refraction effects under light. The camera is placed slightly tilted, as if floating above a clean, flawless, seamless pale beige or very light gray studio background.

Lighting is bright, clean professional studio light, focusing on highlighting the transparency, specular reflection and refraction characteristics of the glass material. Sharp and delicate highlights appear on the body chamfers, film slot edges and lens rings, highlighting the crystal texture and luxurious vision. Subtle refraction, light bending and local distortion effects are produced when light penetrates the interior of the glass body, especially obvious in the lens thickness variation area, inside the film slot and near the top viewfinder, greatly enhancing realism and visual impact. A soft, diffuse shadow falls below and slightly behind the camera, giving the picture a sense of groundedness without destroying the minimalist temperament.

The overall aesthetic style is minimalist, modern, and clean, presenting the visual effect of high-end product photography and concept art rendering. The focus of the picture is completely on the crystal clear material performance and classic geometric shape of the glass Polaroid camera. The image as a whole is high-key and shallow depth of field processing, keeping the Polaroid camera in absolute sharp focus, while the background is softly blurred, thereby maximizing the subject.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [example_14] Fluffy Inflatable Toy

Create a high-resolution 3D rendering of the logo in the attachment, the shape should be an inflatable fluffy object. The shape should appear soft and full, like a plush balloon or inflatable toy. Use a smooth matte texture and add subtle fabric folds and stitching to highlight the inflatable effect. The object should be slightly elastic, supplemented by soft shadows and lighting to enhance volume and realism. Place it on a simple background (light gray).

Overlay a subtle semi-transparent facial analysis grid on the entire face, similar to a 3D facial scan grid: fine, soft white lines extending along the facial contours, slightly glossy but not obscuring skin details. Add a clear vertical red laser line on one side of the face, like a futuristic scanning effect. All analysis lines must be soft, concise, and elegant, like a beauty technology advertisement. Create a concise medical beauty infographic using global data percentages to evaluate 5 aging factors: 1. Fine lines and wrinkles; 2. Skin texture and elasticity; 3. Facial volume and sagging; 4. Signs of aging around eyes; 5. Skin tone and pigmentation: For each factor, place a small label with a thin line pointing to the corresponding facial area, and write a short title and a 0-100% actual percentage score (based on global data) next to it, for example: "Fine lines and wrinkles - 18%" "Skin texture and elasticity - 72%" "Facial volume and sagging - 35%" "Signs of aging around eyes - 41%" "Skin tone and pigmentation - 63%". Use concise, modern sans-serif fonts and small technical style text, similar to scientific facial analysis user interface. In the bottom center of the image, display the estimated real age based on the analysis in bold large characters, for example: "Estimated Age: (random number based on facial analysis)". Overall style: Futuristic AI-guided skincare analysis, minimalist, high-end editorial lighting, gender-neutral, suitable for any face.

Environmental Details: On the Chicago River below, modern architectural style cruise ships, water taxis, and kayaks shuttle back and forth. Skyscrapers of various styles line the riverbanks (resembling the Wrigley Building and Tribune Tower), painted using traditional "Jiehua" architectural painting techniques. Elevated railways and moving "L" trains are visible in the background.
Human Activity: The Riverwalk and sidewalks by the bridge are crowded with hundreds of small figures in modern casual wear.

The figure is also wearing the same iconic outfit and striking an iconic pose. The painting supplies on the workbench are minimal to avoid clutter—only two or three small bottles of paint and a spare brush, keeping the focus on the person and the figure. Soft neutral white background, professional studio lighting, shallow depth of field. The composition highlights the person's facial expression looking at the camera and the figure they are painting. The style is clean and crisp, pursuing photorealistic effects, and details of both the person and the figure need to be highly restored.

## [example_85] Contemporary Art Exhibition Space

An avant-garde contemporary art exhibition space themed around the reference image.
The entire exhibition hall (20.0 m x 20.0 m x 8.0 m) integrates architecture, lighting, flooring, walls, 
and ceiling into the artistic expression.

At the far end of the hall stands a massive wall 20 meters wide and 8 meters high. 
In the center of this wall, the theme from the reference image is presented in a monumental artistic form. 
The image is vivid and three-dimensional, rising toward the viewer, becoming the focal point of the entire space.

A system-generated exhibition title plaque is installed below the central wall. 
The title must be abstract, symbolic, and poetic, and must reflect a contemporary artwork. 
No price display is provided.

The floor is polished granite with a reflectance of 0.35–0.40. 
Patterns and light derived from the reference image cascade across the surface of the work, 
resonating with the entire space as if responding to the footsteps of visitors. 
Tactile paving bricks are in a similar color, seamlessly integrated, but only 5 mm high, providing a clear texture. 
The work extends in a straight line from the entrance to the wall, creating a pause point before the artwork. 
After viewing, visitors are naturally guided to an opening on the right side (3 m wide x 3 m high). 
In emergencies, floor-level emergency lighting ensures illumination of 1 lux.

The left and right walls and the ceiling each reinterpret an abstract element from the reference image, 
transforming the entire space into a single artwork. 
The flow of color, form, and light unifies the experience into an artistic whole.

Visitor capacity is limited to 8–25 people. 
All visitors face the large wall, moving in a straight line and pausing at the designated point. 
No one looks back toward the entrance. 
Only one staff member is stationed near the right-side entrance beside the wall. 
All faces are blurred to ensure anonymity.

The composition is stable, with the central vanishing point always aligned with the center of the wall. 
Verticality is within ±0.5°. 
Floor reflections are precise, human figures appear natural. 
Hands always show five fingers, eyes are symmetrical within a 3% margin. 
Fabrics remain flat with no deformation.

Forbidden content: Elements unrelated to the reference image, missing or broken tactile paving, 
visitors facing the entrance, logos or watermarks, overcrowding, toy-like gloss, 2D flat projections, 
neon glow, teal-orange tones, oversaturation, perspective collapse, mismatched reflections, 
anatomical anomalies, extra limbs, distorted faces, excessive outlines, banding, or vignetting.

DoD: The entire venue will be a contemporary artwork centered on the theme of the reference image, 
with the innermost structure forming a unified experience. 
The tactile paving synchronizes perfectly with the flow of light, creating a clear pause point. 
Visitors are immersed in the space itself, and even in reproduction, SSIM will remain stable at 0.95 or above.
