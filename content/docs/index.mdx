f/2.8 aperture 8K resolution photorealistic
```

### Step 3: Generate or Export

You have two options:

1. **Generate Here**: Sign in to render the image directly using our integrated AI models
2. **Copy to Clipboard**: Export the optimized prompt to use in your favorite external AI image generator

## Understanding the Structure

Every optimized prompt follows our proven four-layer architecture:

| Layer | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Subject** | Core subject definition | "A fluffy Persian kitten" |
| **Atmosphere** | Lighting and mood | "Cinematic golden hour lighting" |
| **Detail** | Textures and focus | "Highly detailed fur, sharp focus" |
| **Technical** | Camera and render specs | "f/2.8, 8K, photorealistic" |

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Start simple** — The AI works better with clear, brief ideas
2. **Be specific about subjects** — "Golden retriever puppy" beats "dog"
3. **Trust the process** — Our optimization is tested across multiple AI models
