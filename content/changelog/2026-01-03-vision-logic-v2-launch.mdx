## 👋 A Note from Kai

Hey there! I'm Kai, the solo developer behind Banana Prompts.

For the past few weeks, I've been wrestling with one question: **Why is AI image generation still so intimidating?**

Every time I see users in Discord asking "How do I get that cinematic lighting?" or "Why do my portraits always look stiff?" — I keep thinking: *this shouldn't be something users need to worry about.*

So I rebuilt the entire generation engine from scratch.

**The core philosophy of V2.0 can be summed up in one sentence: Stop trying to read the AI's mind — let the AI understand YOUR logic instead.**

## 🆕 What's New

### 1. Vision Logic Engine 🧠✨

This is the biggest update in this release. We've transformed complex prompt engineering into an intuitive "parameter matrix."

**Before:** 🔄
You had to guess the right combination of "cinematic lighting, golden hour, volumetric fog, film grain, shallow depth of field..." — hoping something would stick.

**After:** ✅
Just open the Vision Logic interface and:
- Select **Lighting** → Golden Hour Glow ☀️
- Select **Mood** → Cinematic 🎬
- Select **Camera** → 35mm Film, f/1.4 📷

The system automatically generates the perfect prompt combination for you.

> 💬 **Inspired by User Feedback**  
> "I spent an entire day tweaking lighting parameters, and it never looked right." — This was the most common complaint I received. Vision Logic was born to solve exactly this pain point.

### 2. Fresh New Homepage 🏠⚡

We've streamlined the homepage. Now you'll see the "Describe your idea" input box the moment you arrive.

**Why?** 💡
Inspiration is fleeting. The old page felt too much like a product brochure. I wanted it to feel like a sketchpad you can grab any time.

### 3. Logic Matrix Visual Builder 🎛️

The Generator page has been completely revamped. Now you can use the "Logic Matrix" panel on the left to:
- Set your **Subject** 👤
- Adjust **Lighting** 💡
- Control **Mood** 🎭
- Choose **Camera Settings** 📸

Every option shows a real-time preview of how it affects your final prompt.
