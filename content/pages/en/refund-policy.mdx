# Refund Policy

**Last modified:** December 8, 2025

At [**Nano Banana Ultra**](https://nanobananaultra.com), we strive to provide high-quality AI tools and resources. However, because our products are digital goods and involve significant server/API costs incurred immediately upon usage, we have established a strict but fair refund policy.

Please read this policy carefully before making a purchase.

## 1. General Refund Principle

**Generally, all sales are final.**

Due to the nature of digital content and the immediate costs incurred by us (e.g., GPU usage, API fees to model providers like OpenAI/Midjourney) when you use the Service, we do not offer refunds for:

- "Change of mind" after using the service.
- Dissatisfaction with the creative style or specific output of the AI (see Section 4).
- Partial use of a subscription period.

## 2. Exceptions: When Do We Offer Refunds?

We may grant refunds in the following specific scenarios, at our sole discretion:

### A. 7-Day Money-Back Guarantee (For First-Time Credit Packs)

We offer a refund for **Credit Pack** purchases if **ALL** of the following criteria are met:

1. The request is made within **7 days** of the original purchase date.
2. You have used **less than 5%** of the purchased credits (or generated fewer than 10 prompts, whichever is lower).
3. This is your **first** refund request.

### B. Technical Errors / Double Billing

If you were charged multiple times for the same transaction due to a technical glitch, or if the Service was completely inaccessible for a prolonged period (more than 24 hours) due to our fault, we will issue a full refund immediately.

### C. Subscription Auto-Renewal (Grace Period)

If you forgot to cancel your subscription and were charged:

- We may offer a refund if you contact us within **48 hours** of the renewal charge.
- **Condition:** You must NOT have used the service (0 usage) during this new billing cycle.
- If you have used the service after renewal, no refund will be issued, but we can cancel future renewals.

## 3. Non-Refundable Scenarios

For clarity, the following situations are **NOT** eligible for a refund:

- **Account Ban:** If your account is terminated due to a violation of our [Terms of Service](/terms-of-service) (e.g., generating illegal content, API abuse, jailbreaking), you forfeit all remaining credits and subscriptions.
- **Used Credits:** If you have used more than 5% of your credits, the package is considered "consumed."
- **Beta Features:** Issues with experimental or "Beta" features are not grounds for a refund.

## 4. AI Output Disclaimer

You acknowledge that AI generation is probabilistic. **We do not issue refunds for specific AI outputs that are inaccurate, hallucinated, or visually flawed.** We provide the *tool* to generate content, not a guarantee of a specific *result*.

## 5. EU/UK Right of Withdrawal (Waiver)

**Notice to customers in the EU/UK:**

By purchasing digital content (Credits/Subscriptions) and starting to use it (e.g., clicking "Generate" or accessing the API), **you expressly consent to the immediate performance of the contract and acknowledge that you thereby lose your right of withdrawal (the standard 14-day cooling-off period).** If you do not wish to waive this right, please do not use the Service after purchase.

## 6. Disputes & Chargebacks (Important)

You agree to contact our support team to resolve any payment issues **before** disputing the charge with your bank or payment provider.

**Penalty:** If you initiate a dispute or chargeback without prior communication ("Friendly Fraud"), we reserve the right to **permanently suspend your account and revoke all access to the Service immediately.** We will also submit your activity logs and this Policy to the payment provider as evidence to contest the dispute.

## 7. Note on Transaction Fees & Cryptocurrency

If your payment was processed via cryptocurrency (e.g., through Creem) or international payment methods:

- **Transaction Fees:** Network costs (Gas fees) and payment processing fees are **non-refundable**.
- **Volatility (USD Anchor):** For cryptocurrency refunds, the refund amount will be calculated based on the **original Fiat (USD) value** of the transaction at the time of purchase. **We are not responsible for any loss in value due to token exchange rate fluctuations between the time of purchase and the time of refund.**

## 8. How to Request a Refund

To submit a request, please contact us at **support@nanobananaultra.com** with:

1. Your Account Email.
2. Order ID / Transaction Reference.
3. A brief explanation of the reason.

We will review your request and respond within **3-5 business days**. If approved, the refund will be credited back to your original payment method within 5-10 business days, depending on your bank's processing time.
