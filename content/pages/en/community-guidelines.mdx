# Community Guidelines

**Last modified:** December 9, 2025

Welcome to **Nano Banana Ultra**! To keep this platform safe, creative, and legal, we ask that you adhere to the following guidelines. **Violation of these rules may result in content removal or permanent account suspension.**

## 1. The Golden Rule: AI Safety & Legality

Do not use our platform or API to generate content that promotes harm. We strictly prohibit:

- **CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material):** Zero tolerance. We will report any such activity to the NCMEC and relevant international law enforcement agencies.
- **NSFW & Explicit Content:** Do not generate or share sexually explicit imagery or non-consensual sexual content (NCMC).
- **Real People (Deepfakes):** Do not generate realistic, compromising, or defamatory images of real people without their consent.
- **Violence & Gore:** Do not generate content depicting excessive violence, self-harm, torture, or cruelty.

## 2. Elections & Political Integrity (Crucial)

You must not use our Service to create content for the purpose of:

- Interfering with or manipulating political elections.
- Spreading disinformation regarding public figures, candidates, or democratic processes.
- **Note:** We strictly adhere to the safety policies of our upstream AI providers (e.g., OpenAI) regarding political usage.

## 3. Security & Prompt Engineering Ethics

- **No "Jailbreaking":** Do not attempt to bypass the safety filters of underlying AI models (e.g., DAN mode, prompt injection).
- **Indirect Injection:** Do not use external data sources to attack the model or extract system prompts.
- **Malware:** Do not share prompts designed to generate cyberattack tools or phishing scripts.

## 4. User Responsibility & Liability

**You are solely responsible for the content you generate.** Nano Banana Ultra acts as a neutral technology provider. By using the Service, you agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any legal claims arising from your generated content.

## 5. Reporting & Appeals

- **Reporting:** If you see violations, please contact us at **support@nanobananaultra.com**.
- **Appeals:** We reserve the right to ban users at our sole discretion. However, if you believe a ban was an error, you may submit an appeal to our support email for manual review.
