## 1. Introduction & Nature of Service

Please read this Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") before using our Service.

**Important Note on Domain & Phishing:** This policy applies **strictly and exclusively** to the website located at **`https://nanobananaultra.com`** (the "Website"). We are not responsible for, nor affiliated with, any other websites sharing similar names but using different domain extensions (e.g., .com, .net). **We accept no liability for any losses incurred if you mistakenly access a phishing site or a domain other than the one specified above.**

**Disclaimer on AI Outputs:** You acknowledge that our Service acts as an interface to Artificial Intelligence models. Due to the probabilistic nature of AI, **we cannot guarantee the accuracy, legality, originality, or reliability of any generated content.** You use the AI outputs at your own risk.

**Nano Banana Ultra** ("we," "our," or "us") operates the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy and our [**Terms of Service**](/terms-of-service).

## 2. Definitions

- **Usage Data:** Data collected automatically regarding how the Service is accessed and used.

We adhere to the principle of data minimization. We only collect data necessary to operate the Service.

### Types of Data Collected

- Cookies and Usage Data.

**2. Usage Data & Logs:**
- IP address, browser type, browser version, timestamp of visit, and interaction logs.

### User Responsibility (Crucial)

**Strict Prohibition on Sensitive Data:** You explicitly agree **NOT** to input any sensitive Personal Identifiable Information (PII), Protected Health Information (PHI), financial data (credit cards), or confidential trade secrets into the prompts or AI input fields.

**Liability Waiver:** If you violate this provision, **Nano Banana Ultra assumes no liability** for the processing, leakage, or third-party usage of such sensitive data included in your prompts.

## 4. Use of Data

Nano Banana Ultra uses the collected data for the following purposes:

- To provide and maintain the Service.
- To process payments via authorized third-party processors.
- To monitor usage, prevent abuse, and debug technical issues.
- To communicate with you regarding service updates.
- To improve our AI prompt engineering based on aggregate usage patterns.

## 5. Data Retention

We retain data only as long as necessary:

- **AI Interaction Logs & Prompts:** We retain technical logs and prompt history for a limited period (typically **30 to 90 days**) for security monitoring, debugging, and service optimization. After this period, logs are either deleted or permanently anonymized.

## 6. Transfer of Data (Cross-Border)

Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — servers located outside of your state or country (e.g., the United States). Our primary infrastructure providers (such as Cloudflare) operate globally. By using the Service, you consent to this transfer.

**For Users in the EEA/EU:** We transfer Personal Data to third countries relying on the European Commission-approved **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)** or other lawful mechanisms to ensure adequate protection.

## 7. Disclosure of Data

We are an independent team and **do not sell your data**. We may disclose data only in the following specific scenarios:

- **Legal Action:** To comply with a legal obligation or valid court order.
- **Service Providers:** To third parties who assist in operating our Service (see Section 9).
- **Business Transactions (Exit Strategy):** If Nano Banana Ultra is involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data may be transferred as a business asset. We will provide notice before your Personal Data serves a different privacy policy.

## 8. Security of Data

We utilize industry-standard security measures (including SSL/TLS encryption and Cloudflare protection) to protect your data. However, remember that no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.

## 9. Service Providers

We employ third-party companies to facilitate our Service.

- **AI Model Providers:** User prompts are transmitted to third-party AI model providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, or open-source models) to generate results.
- **Analytics:** We may use analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics or privacy-focused alternatives) to monitor traffic and usage trends.
- **Payments:** We may provide paid products within the Service. In that case, we use third-party services for payment processing. We **do not** store or collect your payment card details. That information is provided directly to our third-party payment processors whose use of your personal information is governed by their Privacy Policy. These processors adhere to PCI-DSS standards **to ensure** the secure handling of payment information.

## 10. Links to Other Sites

Our Service may contain links to other sites. We assume no responsibility for the content or privacy policies of any third-party sites or services.

## 11. Children's Privacy

Our Service does not address anyone under the age of **16**. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 16.

## 12. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution

**Governing Law:** This Privacy Policy shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the **State of California, United States**, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

**Class Action Waiver:** You and Nano Banana Ultra agree that **each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative action.** Unless both you and Nano Banana Ultra agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person's claims.

**Mandatory Arbitration:** For any dispute you have with Nano Banana Ultra, you agree to first contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. If strict legal action is required, legitimate disputes shall be resolved through binding arbitration rather than in court. The arbitration shall take place in **San Francisco County, California**, or another mutually agreed location.

## 13. Alignment with Global Standards (GDPR)

While our primary governing law is that of the State of California, we recognize the importance of global privacy standards. **We strive to align our practices with the high standards set by the GDPR** to ensure the protection of all user data, regardless of location.
